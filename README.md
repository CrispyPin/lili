# lili text editor
A terminal text editor for Linux. It's built on crossterm so it might partially work on Windows or MacOS but these are not tested and I have no intention of supporting these platforms.

## Features:
- Directory navigation
- Multiple open files
- Internal clipboard (not synced with X11 or wayland yet)
